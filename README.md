# First-Person-Shooter-Gallery-Game
We created a first person shooting gallery using WebGL from scratch. The user can walk around the scene with the WASD or arrow keys, and use their mouse to look around the environment. This game has 30 targets and 25 must be shot down in order to win. Other features such as aiming down sights, full screen, pointer/gimbal locking etc. are supported.
